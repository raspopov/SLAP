	* Russian (19) by Nikolay Raspopov

How to add a new translation:

	1) Download and install poEdit utility - https://poedit.net/
	2) Download language template file: "SLAP.exe.pot" - https://github.com/raspopov/SLAP/blob/master/SLAP/SLAP.exe.pot
	3) Open "SLAP.exe.pot" by poEdit and press "Create new translation" button (at bottom of poEdit window)
	4) Save newly created file under name "SLAP.exe.xx.po" near "SLAP.exe" inside application installation folder,
	   where xx - 2 or 4-digit hexadecimal language code, for example Russian language code is "19" so Russian translation must be
	   named as "SLAP.exe.19.po"
	5) Use "-lang:xx" command-line option to force loading different language, for example to force Russian you must run "SLAP.exe -lang:19"
	6) Send completed translation to <raspopov@cherubicsoft.com>
